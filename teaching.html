            <h2>Make Music</h2>
            <p><i>&quot;Play the music, not the instrument.&quot;</i>
                ― Unknown</p>
            <p>Making music should be the main focus in your classes. Behavior, technique, and musical knowledge are also important, but generally the classes where the most music is being played are also the most successful in those areas. Your students may or may not care about the guitar, but they will almost certainly care about music. To this end a focus on artistry and expression takes precedence over technique, sight-reading, and all the other &quot;boring stuff.&quot; Start making music as soon as you can in the first class and beyond. Take advantage of their initial excitement and try to build upon it. Learning to play music together improves outcomes in several Social Emotional Learning standards, and builds community, confidence, and creativity.</p>
            <h2>Listen</h2>
            <p><i>“Leaders who do not act dialogically, but insist on imposing their decisions, do not organize the people--they manipulate them. They do not liberate, nor are they liberated: they oppress.”</i>
                ― Paulo Freire</p>
            <p>It is far too common in music education for teachers to deposit information into their students. The deposit model of learning deprives students of agency. Classes should be a dialogue between you and the students. Try posing new ideas as problems to be solved together rather than presenting information for students to memorize and parrot back. Incorporating student voices will shift the power to the students and give them a sense of charting their own musical journeys. Allow students to suggest new repertoire. Use their current interests as a starting point to build upon. Arrange a song that they like and bring it back the next class. Making this effort will show students that you hear them and recognize their value. Have your students compose and improvise. Each day, allow the students to make decisions about the music. Provide them opportunities them to voice their opinions about dynamics, phrasing, and other aspects of the music they learn. Decision-making fosters growth in young people and goes a long way towards creating a successful class. </p>
            <h2>Make it Easy</h2>
            <p><i>“Never play anything that&#39;s hard! If it&#39;s hard, don&#39;t play it!”</i>
                ― Joe Pass</p>
            <p>All kidding aside, there is some truth in what Joe said. If you can play a part easily you are more likely to play it musically and with expression. If you are preoccupied and overwhelmed with the technical difficulty of a part then you&#39;ll never perform it with true artistry. Learning an instrument can be tedious. It&#39;s easy for students to become frustrated and confused. This can kill their initial enthusiasm. Set your students up for success so they can express themselves and develop the creative tools they need. </p>
            <h2>Review</h2>
            <p><i>&quot;A rose is a rose is a rose&quot;.</i>
                ― Gertrude Stein</p>
            <p>Review is an essential part of any pedagogy, but it is especially important in our program. You will only see most your students for 50 minutes a week. Most of them will not have a guitar at home. Absences are common as are field trips, testing, and other contingencies. It&#39;s unrealistic to expect them to retain much from to week to week. Start off each class by playing something together. Something they already know and can play successfully with expression. Then build off of that success.</p>
            <h2>Establish Routines</h2>
            <p><i>“If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine; it is lethal.”</i>
                ― Paulo Coelho</p>
            <p>It&#39;s important to establish routines early on. Routines reduce disruptive behavior and save precious class time. Students are more likely to be focused if they know what to expect. They are more likely to be able to work independently which will free you to observe and ensure that you are giving each student the attention they deserve. Make your expectations simple and clear from the very first class. Be consistent with your expectations and follow through fairly with the consequences when they are not met. Routines make things easier, but routines don&#39;t have to be &quot;lethal.&quot; Effective lesson planning should leave space for variety. Fill this space with games and other fun activities to keep things fresh and engaging. </p>
            <h2>Be Ready to Shift Gears</h2>
            <p><i>&quot;When you come to a fork in the road.... take it.&quot;</i>
                ― Yogi Berra</p>
            <p>Let&#39;s face it: sometimes your lesson plan isn&#39;t going to work. Learn to recognize when things are unraveling and adjust accordingly. Have a repertoire of activities that you can pull from when you need them. Planning your lesson is important, but so is knowing how to improvise. Learn to roll with the punches and take the class to where it needs to go next. </p>
            <h2>Stay Calm</h2>
            <p><i>&quot;Leadership is the ability to hide your panic from others&quot;.</i>
                ― Loazi</p>
            <p>Things in a middle school classroom can get pretty chaotic. Maintaining a calm attitude is not easy, but it is essential. Students can read the energy that you are giving off. If you are calm, they are more likely to be calm. If you are anxious, they are more likely to be anxious. Don&#39;t lose your cool, even when tempers are flaring. Use the &quot;drain off&quot; technique. It takes two sides to escalate a situation. You can&#39;t get in an argument with yourself. </p>
            <p>Michael Linsin writes in his blog post 5 Ways To Be A Calmer, More Effective Teacher, &quot;Maintaining a calm attitude throughout your teaching day is a choice you make before your students arrive. So every day, sometime prior to the morning bell, give yourself a moment of peace to sit quietly at your desk. Take a few deep breaths and relax into your chair. Now decide that no matter what happens that day, no matter how crazy or how alarming, you will not lose your composure. And guess what? You won’t. This technique, employed by scores of professional athletes, seems almost too easy. But it’s remarkably, inexplicably effective.&quot;</p>
            <h2>Sell Your Lesson</h2>
            <p><i>“You&#39;ve got to dig it to dig it, you dig?”</i>
                ― Thelonious Monk</p>
            <p>The biggest advantage that you have as a guitar teacher is that your subject matter is inherently interesting. And you love it, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have spent thousands of hours in solitary confinement practicing scales and arpeggios. If you exude this passion when you teach, your students will notice. Sell them on your lesson before you begin. Tell them why it&#39;s going to be awesome. Write the bullet-points of your lesson plan on the board. When students know what to expect they will be more relaxed and more likely to succeed. They will have something to look forward to. It won&#39;t take long. A 60 second sales pitch at the beginning of class can go a long way. </p>
