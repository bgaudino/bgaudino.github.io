		<p>Brian Gaudino joined the CCGS team in 2016 and was promoted to Director of Education in 2017. In this role, he leads CCGS classroom instruction, trains and supports teachers, develops new programs and initiatives, and serves as the liaison between CCGS and site location teachers and administrators.

In 2020, Brian launched Guitar@Home Academy, which provides free private guitars lessons over video chat to any students that attend a Cleveland school.

As a performer, Brian was selected as a member of the inaugural United States Guitar Orchestra, which premiered three new compositions at Carnegie Hall and toured France. In addition to classical, Brian performs in a variety of other genres. He placed fifth in the 2020 international Kiesel Guitars Solo Competition.
